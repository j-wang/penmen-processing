#Penmen Processing

##About
Problem given by Jessica McKellar to Hacker Schoolers during her residency.
Find the duplicate penmen within noisy pictures of penmen posters.

##Motivation
I've never done image processing, so I wanted to take a crack at it. I figured this would be good to dispel the "magic" involved in it and also give me a good algorithm challenge.

##Requirements
- numpy
- scipy
- PIL with jpg and pneg support (libjpeg and libpng)

##Format
Currently in iPython notebook. I'll probably refactor this code at some point into a .py file.
